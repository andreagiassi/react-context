# React Context

#### Overview
This is a small project to explain how to propagate variables using the context instead props with the Reactjs javascript framework.

Context is designed to share data that can be considered global for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

In this small project I've shared an userId and a security token across the DOM tree using a UserProvider.

# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
